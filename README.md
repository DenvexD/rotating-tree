# rotating-tree
I solved an interesting info competition question and wanted to upload it on github
you just insert a tree as a string ex. (()()) would create a tree with two knots left and right.
The program checks if you can rotate the tree and its size matches in the middle to the not rotated tree with a visualistaion.
